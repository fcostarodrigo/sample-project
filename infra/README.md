# Infrastructure

Infrastructure described and deployed using AWS CDK.

## Web push notification keys

The keys are stored in a secret separate from the CDK stack following the documentation recommendation.
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_secretsmanager-readme.html

The keys are generated during the setup step.
